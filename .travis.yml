before_script:
  ## runs the 'start' script which
  ## boots our local app server on port 8888
  ## which cypress expects to be running
  ## -----------------------------------
  ## the '-- --silent' passes arguments
  ## to grunt serve which silences its output
  ## else our travis logs would be cluttered
  ## with output
  ## ---------------------------------------
  ## we use the '&' ampersand which tells
  ## travis to run this process in the background
  ## else it would block execution and hang travis
  - grunt serve --silent &

script:
  ## now run cypress in CI mode
  ## which runs all of the tests
  ## and uses the CYPRESS_CI_KEY
  ## environment var by default
  ## which you need to configure
  ## on Travis CI behind the scenes
  - cypress ci

  ## alternatively we could specify
  ## a specific secret key to use
  ## like this without having to
  ## configure anything in Travis CI:
  ## - cypress ci 703b33d9-a00e-4c66-90c2-40efc0fee2c6
